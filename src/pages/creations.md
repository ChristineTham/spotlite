      - item: Adagio (2nd movement) from Oboe Concerto in D minor Alessandro Marcello
        parent: Soundcloud
        description: >
          My first arrangement for 2018! This is a synth arrangement of the slow movement from Alessandro Marcello's beautiful Oboe Concerto in D minor, op. 1 using Logic Pro native instruments. It is a beautiful and tranquil piece that is perhaps not well known (even though JS Bach transcribed it for harpsichord).

      - item: Olhos De Gato (orchestral arrangement)
        parent: Soundcloud
        description: >
          To celebrate the completion of the Jazz Improvisation class I am taking, I have arranged Olhos de Gato, by Carla Bley (one of the pieces studied in class) for orchestra. I have created a string backing for the melody, then added the melody from "Memories of Tomorrow" (another piece studied in class) as a counterpoint, and also my own melody as a further counterpoint. Finally, I created a new ending, based on a descending harmonic progression.
          The arrangement is scored in Notion, orchestrated using EWQL Symphony Orchestra Gold and mastered using Ozone 5.

        description: >
          Incorrectly ascribed to Guilio Caccini, this work was actually composed by Vladimir Fyodorovich Vavilov (Влади́мир Фёдорович Вави́лов) in 1970 and featured in his album "Lute music of the XVI-XVII cent." (Лютневая музыка 16-17 веков) released on the Melodiya label.
          I listened to the original recording, transcribed it to Notion, then rearranged it for woodwinds, strings and harp, voiced using the EWQL Symphonic Orchestra.

          This is my arrangement of Chick Corea's beautiful song for string quartet. I took the lead sheet and expanded it to four parts for string quartet, with each instrument (apart from cello) taking turns to play the melody, with the other instruments either providing counterpoint or harmony.

          This my attempt at jazz arrangement and improvisation, inspired by an assignment from Gary Burton's Jazz Improvisation course at Coursera. I took the original lead sheet provided in the assignment, then expanded to four parts that are polyrhythmic as well as polyphonic (based on Latin rhythms). I also added separate improvisations for piano and flute. Finally, I added open-voiced string harmonisation in the final section to indicate the guide tones and basis for future improvisation.
